Translation will be made using [gpt-3.5-turbo](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/making-requests) which gives much more accurate translation than DeepL and Google Translate, though, of course, still does not reach the lebel of a human translation.

The recordings follow this guide: http://sagaoz.net/foolmaker/game/k/euthanasia.html which goes:
- True End Roude (lap #1)
- Untrue END1 Route (lap #2)
- Untrue END2 Route (lap #3)
And is supposed to at least cover all CGs. Hopefully it covers 99.9% of all the text content too.

Similar to [Muramasa](https://github.com/klesun/muramasa-vn-translation), this repo will hold textracted Japanese texts from the VN and all translations I'll manage to produce
