Youtube playthrough with English captions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=akB071ganDU&list=PL-0iwBRR7TeYrOsrIeg_pQUqrJruzwDvT

The recordings follow this guide: http://sagaoz.net/foolmaker/game/k/euthanasia.html which goes:
- True End Roude (lap #1)
- Untrue END1 Route (lap #2)
- Untrue END2 Route (lap #3)
And is supposed to at least cover all CGs. Hopefully it covers 99.9% of all the text content too.

Similar to [Muramasa](https://github.com/klesun/muramasa-vn-translation), this repo will hold textracted Japanese texts from the VN and all translations I'll manage to produce
